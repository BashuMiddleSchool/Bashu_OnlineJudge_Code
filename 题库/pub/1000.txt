1000 -- 【入门题目】A+B Problem
Description
计算 a+b ,其中a,b都是整数
Input
输入两个整数a,b (0 <= a,b <= 1000)
Output
输出a+b的和
Sample Input
1 2
Sample Output
3
Hint
Q: Where are the input and the output?

A: Your program shall always read input from stdin (Standard Input) and write output to stdout (Standard Output). For example, you can use 'scanf' in C or 'cin' in C++ to read from stdin, and use 'printf' in C or 'cout' in C++ to write to stdout.

You shall not output any extra data to standard output other than that required by the problem, otherwise you will get a "Wrong Answer".

User programs are not allowed to open and read from/write to files. You will get a "Runtime Error" or a "Wrong Answer" if you try to do so.

Here is a sample solution for problem 1000 using C++/G++:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
int a,b;
cin >> a >> b;
cout << a+b << endl;
return 0;
}

It's important that the return type of main() must be int when you use G++/GCC,or you may get compile error.

Here is a sample solution for problem 1000 using C/GCC:

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
int a,b;
scanf("%d %d",&a, &b);
printf("%d\n",a+b);
return 0;
}

Here is a sample solution for problem 1000 using PASCAL:

program p1000(Input,Output);
var
a,b:Integer;
begin
Readln(a,b);
Writeln(a+b);
end.
